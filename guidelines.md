# Portfolio website

This repository, together with the Django application, are intended to be my portfolio. In order to take my career to the next level, I have decided to make public, in an incremental way, the different projects that I have been developing along my career as Machine Learning Developer.

## Website structure

In order to *plan* the development of this portfolio, I have decided to mark the following elements in the portfolio I want:

The header will have a series of buttons that will be reactive to lead to each of the sections that the project will have, listed below are the ones devised at first and the attached description:

1. **About me**: Page with two columns, in the first one an image and links to my social networks (at the bottom of the image). In the second column a text with personal information, a short summary of my career and below a list of buttons to the rest of the sections.

2. **Skills**: Page with a matrix of (n x 3 x 2), in each cell there will be a header which is an image representing a skill and a text explaining the skill.

3. **Personal projects**: Matrix with background images and hyperlinks to sample web applications of the different projects developed.

4. **GitHub**: Button with access to GitHub.

5. **TFG**: Link to the TFG.

6. **Timeline**: Career progression through the different companies I have worked for. Each company will be a ball with the company logo, dates, and explanation of my contributions.

7. **Contact**: Email, telephone and contact form.

8. **CV**: Link to the CV.

Finally there will be a footer with buttons to the social networks, links to the “About me” section, “Contact” and CV download.
